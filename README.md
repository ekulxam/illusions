# Illusions

This mod adds several funhouse mirrors to Minecraft. Created for [Modfest: Carnival]([modfest.net](https://modfest.net/carnival))

Mirrors can be placed onto walls similar to paintings, and will show a reflection of the world in front of them. There are four types: Normal, Swirl Distortion, Vertical Distortion, and Wiggly Distortion. All types are accessible as items via the functional items inventory tab. Currently there are no crafting recipes available.
